# What is this

An "almost" step-by-step recreation of the AngularJS official tutorial app.
I did this to familiarize myself with the basics of AngularJS.
If you are looking for a simple tutorial app to get started, I suggest you take a look at [the AngularJS official tutorial app](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). Then you can make one on your own, just like what I did here :)

# Why is this empty

Just like the original tutorial, each step is put into a stand alone branch.
Checkout branches to see changes:

```
git branch
git checkout $BranchName
```
